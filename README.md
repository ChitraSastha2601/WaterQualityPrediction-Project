# WaterQualityPrediction-Project
 Utilizing machine learning algorithms, I aim to predict water quality parameters based on various environmental factors. By analyzing historical data and employing regression or classification techniques, I seek to model and forecast water quality indicators such as pH levels, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and more.
